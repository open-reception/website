title: Problem Analysis Interview
description: Join our research and test group
---

This is a research project funded by the [Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space](https://www.bmbf.de) and the [PrototypeFund](https://prototypefund.de/).

We are conducting a problem analysis for practical development.

## What is being developed here?

We are developing an encrypted appointment booking platform where your patients can book appointments with you. **All information within is encrypted** and is only available to you and your patients.

## What's in it for me?

If you currently use other providers and upload your entire patient base there (possibly automatically), you are operating in a legal grey area.

You are using order processing. However, these service providers may not process this data solely for your purposes. Additionally, your patients may not have consented to this practice.

When you use OpenReception in the future, you will **need to collect fewer signatures** and have full control over your patient data.

Furthermore, **OpenReception will be significantly cheaper than other providers**.

Practices that participate in the development:

- can **help shape the outcome**,
- will be **the first to receive the software**,
- receive an **exclusive discount for booking an appointment booking platform**,
- will be **mentioned on the website** in our report upon request (including link if desired).

## What can I expect?

In an about 15-minute conversation, we will discuss:

- the workflows within your practice,
- which software you might currently be using, and
- what problems you have with the current solution.

We conduct this conversation via video conference or telephone.

During the course of the project, we conduct solution interviews that last about 15 to 30 minutes. Participation in these is optional.

## How can I participate?

Write to us personally through the channel where we contacted you or get in touch via email at _team[at]open-reception.org_.
