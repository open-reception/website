title: Solution Interview
description: Participate in our Solution Interviews
---

In June and July 2025, we conducted qualitative problem interviews with medical practices. We interviewed doctors and their staff about _problems_ with online appointment booking. The results are incorporated into the conception and design of OpenReception.

**Now we are looking for medical practices that want to evaluate our solution in an interview.**

> Although we are developing an online appointment booking system using medical practices as an example, we aim to create a universally applicable tool.

## What's in it for me?

If you currently use other providers and upload your entire patient base there (possibly automatically), you are operating in a legal grey area.

You are using order processing. However, these service providers may not process this data solely for your purposes. Additionally, your patients may not have consented to this practice.

When you use OpenReception in the future, you will **need to collect fewer signatures** and have full control over your patient data.

Furthermore, **OpenReception will be significantly cheaper than other providers**.

Practices that participate in the development:

- can **help shape the outcome**,
- will be **the first to receive the software**,
- receive an **exclusive discount for booking an appointment booking platform**,
- will be **mentioned on the website** in our report upon request (including link if desired).

## What can I expect?

In about a 30-minute conversation, we will discuss:

- the workflows in OpenReception and how they fit in your practice,
- test for usability issues and
- discuss possible issues and obstacles for implementing OpenReception in your practice

We conduct this conversation via video conference.

## How can I participate?

Write to us personally through the channel where we contacted you or get in touch via email at _team[at]open-reception.org_.
