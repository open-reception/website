OpenReception is being developed by [Karl Ludwig Weise](https://ludwigweise.de) and [Hendrik Belitz](https://innovation-through-understanding.de/) as part of the [PrototypeFund](https://prototypefund.de/) year one.

We are developing an online appointment booking system for medical practices and healthcare facilities.
