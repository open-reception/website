When patients want to book an appointment online today, they often have to enter their most personal data into the input forms of large companies. What exactly happens with this data is often unclear to all parties involved.

Patients are virtually forced to agree to every privacy policy. Doctors submit to the wishes of the large platforms; due to lack of knowledge, stress, and lack of alternatives.

That's why we are now developing an encrypted appointment booking platform where patients can book appointments with medical practices. A prototype will be developed within six months.

The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space.

## Involvement of Medical Practices

For this purpose, we would like to involve medical practices early on to ensure we develop close to their needs.

The interview takes about 15 minutes. There are several benefits for practices that participate. You can find all information at: https://open-reception.org/de/research/problem-analysis/

## Free Open-Source Software and Public Development

We are developing software that can be used by everyone. Therefore, our results are freely available. You can find our GitHub repository at https://github.com/open-reception/appointment-booking-software

Our project board is also public, allowing everyone to transparently follow our work: https://github.com/orgs/open-reception/projects/1

## Save the Date: Demo Day

We will present our prototype at the Prototype Fund's Demo Day on November 28, 2025 (9 AM to 6 PM) in Berlin.

Further information will follow here and on social media.
