## Next: SecondStage

We've also been granted the PrototypeFund's SecondStage and will be setting up our prototype for everyone to participate and use. This program will run until the end of March 2026.

### Involvement of Medical Practices

Part of our SecondStage will be solution interviews with medical practices. This interview takes about 30 minutes. There are several benefits for practices that participate. You can find all information at: https://open-reception.org/de/research/solution-interview/

## Free Open-Source Software

OpenReception can be used by everyone. Our results are freely available. You can find our GitHub repository at https://github.com/open-reception/appointment-booking-software
