description: This is the Code of Conduct for OpenReception
---

Version 1.0 from December 17, 2025

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a safe experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, sexual identity, sexual orientation or any other dimension of diversity.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## When this Code of Conduct applies

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is publicly representing the community in other spaces like

- GitHub repositories (like issues, pull requests, commit messages, and discussions),
- our digital community meetup (held as video conference),
- our social media accounts,
- representing our community or
- acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Expected Behaviour

To maintain a positive environment, we expect all community members to adhere to the following standards.

- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** towards other people.
- **Being respectful of differing opinions**, viewpoints, and experiences.
- **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.**
- **Accepting responsibility and apologizing** to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- **Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.**
- **Respecting boundaries** in both digital and physical spaces.

## Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behavior will be prosecuted under this Code of Conduct.

- Physical or psychological violence and threats of such violence including encouraging a person to commit self-harm.
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical address, without their explicit permission (doxing).
- **In-person specific:** Unwanted physical contact, blocking someone's path, or sustained disruption of talks or events.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community enforcement team responsible for enforcement at **team {at} open-reception.org**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unwelcome behavior from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from our activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.

Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

**Anyone being asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately**. Violation of these guidelines can result in anyone being asked to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.

In addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.
